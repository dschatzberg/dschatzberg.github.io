<div class="entry-content"><p>Our current operating systems grew out of an environment where
multiple users with multiple applications shared a single machine. The
kernel&rsquo;s role was first and foremost to securely multiplex the shared
resources (disks, memory, processors). This has largely remained
true. However, due to advances in virtualization, networking, and
datacenter computing, an increasingly important class of applications
are dedicated to one or more machines.</p>

<p>Many of these applications are ill-served by existing operating
systems. The requirement of secure multiplexing of resources is
removed and so a significant portion of the operating system causes
unnecessary overhead. This is by no means a unique observation; both
<a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/mirage-os.html">Mirage OS</a>
and <a href="http://osv.io/">OSv</a> are new operating systems designed for cloud
applications running on virtualized infrastructure.</p>

<p>So I can take a cloud application and port it to one of these two
systems and I suspect for many applications I would see a performance
improvement. Thats not to say that it would be worth doing for all
applications; there is still effort involved in porting a working
application. One would have to estimate the return on investment in
programmer effort to decide if such an effort it worthwhile.</p>

<p>This leads me to wonder, what is the best performance I could acheive
for a particular application and how much effort would be required to
acheive such performance. Pretty clearly in a perfect world each such
application would be deployed with an application-specific system. So
why is this not the way these applications are constructed?</p>

<p>At least one primary answer is the effort in building a freestanding
binary (I&rsquo;ll reuse this terminology to refer to an application without
an underlying OS) makes it generally not worth the gains. What would
change this balance?</p>

<p>1) The gains improve. The operating system is involved most in I/O
heavy workloads. Compute heavy workloads do not involve crossing
protection boundaries. Classically, I/O heavy workloads have been
dominated by hardware costs (network latency, disk seek latency,
etc.). However, improvements in networking (Infiniband, switches,
etc.) and storage (NVRAM, flash, etc.) have lowered the hardware costs
to the point where the software costs are not an insignificant factor.</p>

<p>2) The effort to build a freestanding binary is reduced. Building an
Operating System is a lot of work. Fortunately convergence in hardware
has made some issues such as drivers less of a factor. Still, for a
Linux application, the amount of code necessary to replace Linux for
that application might be much more code than the rest of the
application.</p>

<p>So I argue that the gains one would get, at least for a class of
applications (typically datacenter/cloud applications), are
increasing. Both the previous systems recognize this and target these
applications. So how do we reduce the effort needed to build a
freestanding binary? Well clearly there are pieces of functionality
which are common amongst many applications. But rather than extracting
these out and calling them an operating system (or runtime). We should
seek to build a library of freestanding components which can be used
to construct freestanding binaries (be they applications, runtimes or
operating systems).</p>

<p>One could argue this was the goal of
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">OSKit</a>, a relatively old project
which sought to lower the barrier to entry to building operating
systems by providing components of systems software. However, OSKit
made a significant mistake. They used a relatively heavy-weight
mechanism to interface between components. Each OSKit interface is
specified using Component Object Model (COM) to create a binary
interface. This performance cost of interfacing creates a tension. At
any point a programmer must decide whether decomposing a piece of
software is worth the performance hit. This requires</p>

<p>1) Estimating the performance hit of the interface. Doing so is very
difficult and impossible to do accurately without the set of
applications which intend to run on the system</p>

<p>2) Estimating the value of decomposing the software. Will the new
component be reusable? For which systems and applications?</p>

<p>Making this judgement is impossible without restricting the
applications that intend to use the components. And so, OSKit was
forced to be a library of components for a specific kind of operating
systems which fit well with the particular coarse grain decomposition
that was chosen by the OSKit developers.</p>

<p>Can we avoid the tradeoff between decomposition and performance?
Ideally we could write components of software and when composed the
generated code is as good as hand optimized code written without
decomposition. Indeed, a technique called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> allows
programmers to write code that generates code.</p>

<p>This is a well known technique even if the name is not
commonplace. For example,
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/">lwIP</a> is a lightweight
TCP/IP stack written in C that can be embedded in applications and
systems. The system requires some form of memory allocation and so
instead of calling <code>malloc</code> and requiring the need to link with a
function called <code>malloc</code>, lwIP called <code>mem_malloc</code> which is a macro
that is defined by the user. This allows the memory allocation of lwIP
to be controlled according to the demands of the system or application
that uses it. Because it is defined as a macro, it is just as good as
if the code had been written directly in place and the compiler can
inline function calls as usual.</p>

<p>Equivalently in C++, templates can be used to perform
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming">generic programming</a>
which allows code to be written without specifying concrete
types. This technique was used in the STL and its use greatly
influenced the C++ standard library. With these techniques composition
is no longer at odds with performance.</p>

<p>That is not to say that there won&rsquo;t be orthogonal sets of
components. The type of components one might use to build an
application targeting a small virtual machine might be largely
orthogonal to those used to build an application targeting a
distributed, multicore, datacenter.</p>

<p>That largely summarizes my thoughts on the current research question
at hand. Next time I will discuss concretely how this research
question can be explored and evaluated.</p>
